# Dropshipping project

This project is a more in depth react application that simulates a shopping website.

It uses a simple json server to host a mock backend and focuses react and material-ui to create the display.

## How to run:

Clone the repo as you would normally.

Run `npm install` in the project directory.

To start the json server: run `npm run server` in the project directory.

In a separate terminal (in the same directory), run `npm start`. 

Your browser should open on 'http://localhost:3000' to display the app.


### Usage:

You can click the 'category' dropdown in the upper left to choose from the available item categories.

You can click the basket icon at the bottom right of each item to add it to the cart.

Click the cart in the top left to view your current items. 

You can change the quantities of each item, and it will update the price to pay for that item and subtotal. 

You can remove each item individually, or empty the entire cart with the 'empty cart' button in the bottom right.

The checkout button does not currently work.
